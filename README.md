## Technologies Used
-Node
-Javascript
-Express
-Css
-dotenv
-mongoose
-nodemon
-react

## Accessing the Application from React

To access this todo list: in the terminal, navigate to the server folder using Git Bash and execute the command "npm start". Then, in the command prompt (cmd), navigate to the todo-list-todo-list folder and also execute the command "npm start".

You can delete, update, and add items using the "update", "delete", and "add" buttons.

You need to create an Atlas account and connect it to the app. In that case, you should change the password and username in the .env file. Delete "<#Anything that is found here>" and replace it with your password.

You can verify the updates or deletions from your Atlas account.

You can also test it using Postman.
